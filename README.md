You can download Python from the official Python website. Make sure to install basic libraries such as NumPy and PyTorch. You can do this using the package manager `pip`.

## üìö Learning Path

The learning journey is broken down into clear topics. Each day introduces new concepts and hands-on exercises:

1. **Day 1-7: Machine Learning Basics**
   - Understand core concepts like supervised vs. unsupervised learning.
   - Learn key algorithms including linear regression and decision trees.

2. **Day 8-14: Mathematics for Machine Learning**
   - Explore essential math concepts such as linear algebra and calculus.
   - Apply these concepts to real-world problems.

3. **Day 15-21: Deep Learning Fundamentals**
   - Discover neural networks and their architectures.
   - Implement basic models using TensorFlow and PyTorch.

4. **Day 22-30: Advanced Deep Learning**
   - Dive into complex networks like transformers.
   - Implement advanced architectures and participate in mini-projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-on Implementation

Each module contains code snippets and exercises. Follow these steps to run the application:

1. **Setup Python Environment**
   - Open your command line or terminal.
   - Create a new virtual environment using:
     ```
     python -m venv myenv
     ```
   - Activate the environment:
     - For Windows:
       ```
       myenv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - For macOS/Linux:
       ```
       source myenv/bin/activate
       ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**
   - In the terminal, run:
     ```
     pip install numpy pytorch
     ```

3. **Run Sample Code**
   - Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the repository.
   - Locate the example files in the `examples` folder.
   - Run a Python script as a test:
     ```
     python examples/sample_script.py
     ```
